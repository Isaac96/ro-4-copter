#summary Tips when building the flight controller prototype

There is a circuit design to follow when building the flight control board, but there is no board layout yet.

Remember that the accelerometer sensor should be kept close to the aircraft's center. The outputs of the sensors should be kept close to the ADC inputs of the microcontroller.

Everything runs on a 5V supply provided by the ESCs, although a regulated 3.3V supply is needed for the analog reference and the IMU.

Using a 2x5 header for two ESC lines can prevent you from plugging in the wires backwards, if you remember that ground is in the center.

The 20MHz oscillator should be mounted in a 14 pin DIP socket. This allows you to use both full size and half sized oscillators. In the event that an oscillator is damaged during a crash, the socket allows for a quick replacement.

The JTAG and multiple ISP headers shown in the circuit diagrams are optional, add them according to the equipment available to you.
