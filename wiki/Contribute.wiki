=How you can help me=

You are helping simply by using Ro4Copter. Build a quadcopter using Ro4Copter, fly it, and tell me what went wrong, what went right, what you liked and didn't like.

I don't have all the resources to buy stuff to test so you can help by trying out different sensors and equipment for me.

Experiment with adding stuff like exotic lighting or extra servos. Utilize the extra GPIOs that Ro4Copter provides.

Feel free to edit the any of the files. You can check out anything in the SVN depository. If you want to submit a change, submit it via the "Issues" tab and tag the issue as an enhancement.
