#summary Steps to build this quadrotor helicopter

There are several flaws in the first prototype design, so this page will not go into too much detail. This page will instead offer some tips.

= Frame =

The frame consists of two 5" by 5" aluminum plates, and four arms made of 3/4" wide aluminum angle beams. These pieces are bolted together to form a X shape.

Another 5" by 5" sheet of aluminum is hung under the bottom of the main body using extra long bolts, this sheet supports the battery and RC radio receiver.

The motor base pieces are bolted to the end of each aluminum arm.

The flight controller is mounted on top of the aluminum plates with a sheet of polycarbonate in between to prevent any electrical shorts. Use spring washers to mount the circuit board so that you can adjust it's tilt by adjusting the tension of the nuts.

= Circuit =

It is ideal for the accelerometer to be placed right at the center of the helicopter for maximum accuracy.

Make lots of test points, use wire loops for things you need to probe with anything like multimeters, oscilloscopes, or logic analyzers.
