#summary Choosing an RC Radio

The radio used with the first prototype is a [http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/JS-6/6-CHANNEL-TRANSMITTER-AND-RECEIVER/-/1.html VEX transmitter + receiver kit]. This may be hard to find now, but any receiver with a PPM output should work with the flight controller.

Here's some examples of radio systems that has a PPM output.

If a PPM radio could not be found, another microcontroller could control the flight controller via the extension port.
